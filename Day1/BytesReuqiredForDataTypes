Character are stored with its corresponding ASCII value for 'a' --> its '97' and for 'A' --> its '65';

for example:

char character = 'a';
int output = character + 3; // Implicit type casting. Convert character data type to integer automatically.
System.out.println(output); // Output is 100

char explicitTyped = (char) output; //explicit conversion take place
System.out.println(explicitTyped); // output is 'c'
