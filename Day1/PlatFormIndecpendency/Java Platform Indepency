Why Java Platform Independent:

Compiler provides the .class file after compilation of .java code. This .java file is converted as machine code
(Native Code) or binary code by JVM, By this behaviour it is executed in any operating system whether it is windows,
Mac or Linux.

Why C++ is not platform independent:

Because before executing on the hardware device these cpp files should be first compiled and should be converted in
.exe or .out file for Mac. These .exe files not be same for all operating system. Because these files is generated
by the compiler itself according to there corresponding operating system. So the executable file for windows should
not be run on linux operating system.
