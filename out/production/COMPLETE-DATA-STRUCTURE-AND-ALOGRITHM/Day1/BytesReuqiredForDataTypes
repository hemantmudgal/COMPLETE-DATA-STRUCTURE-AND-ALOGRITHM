byte (Byte) : 1 byte
short (Short) : 2 bytes
int (Integer) : 4 bytes
long (Long) : 8 bytes
float (Float) : 4 bytes
double (Double) : 8 bytes
boolean (Boolean) : Not Define
char (Character) : 2 byte


Character are stored with its corresponding ASCII value for 'a' --> its '97' and for 'A' --> its '65';

for example:

char character = 'a';
int output = character + 3; // Implicit type casting. Convert character data type to integer automatically.
System.out.println(output); // Output is 100

char explicitTyped = (char) output; //explicit conversion take place
System.out.println(explicitTyped); // output is 'c'


All floating point value represented as a double data type in java. So it required 8 bytes of memory.
For representing float data type 'f' is required after the value of float.
example: float value = 3f; // 4 bytes of memory;
         float anotherValue = 3; // Through an error. Treated as double so for that reason 3 is represented in 8 bytes of memory and this
                                 //will not store in 4 bytes of memory.
